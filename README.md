## Overview

Interactext is an interactive fiction tool used to write/play games written in a legible syntax, composed online with a decent GUI, extensible through javascript and supporting a rich set of features.

This is a Work In Progress, and the README will be updated as progress is made porting over and improving on AdventureText, the Windows-only predecessor to this work.
