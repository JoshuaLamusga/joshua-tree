## Overview

Interactext is an open-source tool for authoring and playing works of interactive fiction directly in the browser. It can create both "hyperlink" and "parser" style games. Games are represented as specially-formatted text, which can be hand-edited (as with Inform) or generated with the help of dialogs (as with ADRIFT).

Interactext includes an editor and runner. The runner supports live testing.
